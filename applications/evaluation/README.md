Post-training Analysis
======================

This directory contains a set of general scripts for post-training
evaluation and analysis of networks trained within yoke.


Tasks include:
--------------

1. Plotting of training and validation curves.
2. Evaluation of trained network on the test set.
3. (non-Image prediction) Scatter-plot of ground
   truth vs. prediction for the test set.
4. (non-Image prediction) Histograms of ground truth
   vs. prediction for the test set.


Image-output networks:
----------------------

For image prediction networks a simple plotting script to compare true
image vs. predicted image is provided.
